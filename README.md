# django_webapp
This is my August project for the school. Itâ€™s a classic website with a connection that takes information from a given API. The API revolves around basketball.

## How to install and use my project ?

Clone my Github project with : `git clone https://github.com/Braante/django_webapp.git`

Enter in the folder of the project : `cd django_webapp/webapp/env/Script/`

Use this command to enable the virtual environment : `activate.bat`

By activating the virtual environment, you can launch the site with Django.

Go to the heart of the project to launch the website : `cd ../../webapp/`

Run the project : `py manage.py runserver`

You juste have to click on the link in the terminal.
